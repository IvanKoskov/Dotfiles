# Personal workflow configuration

My current working device is M1 Mac Air with MacOS Sonoma installed on it (no SIP).

This repo includes my preferences, settings and just configs not only for my workflows, but also text editor, terminal and more.

Most of the dot files do not have any hardcoded values or path. Everything can be used out of the box by downloading or cloning this repo directly.

## What i use for managing my _dotfiles_ ?

I use a tool called ```stow```. While dotfiles are just alieses they still require you to organize them.

Install ```stow``` using [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) and ```brew install stow```.
