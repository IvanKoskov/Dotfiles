# Personal workflow configuration

My current working device is M1 Mac Air with MacOS Sonoma installed on it (no SIP).

This repo includes my preferences, settings and just configs not only for my workflows, but also text editor, terminal and more.

Most of the dot files do not have any hardcoded values or path. Everything can be used out of the box by downloading or cloning this repo directly.

## What i use for managing my _dotfiles_ ?

I use a tool called ```stow```. While dotfiles are just alieses they still require you to organize them.

Install ```stow``` using [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) and ```brew install stow```.

## Software of choice

Default tools, apps or anything that i can use for a specific task explained.

Something to take note about is that sometimes i change between different tools for editing any files like vim, macvim, xcode. It depends on the workflow i am in right now. If i am doing anything in the GUI i use macvim or xcode ( if task requires heavy tools, IDE goods for an apple macos specific work ). However if i am in terminal or doing anything else i use vim only. All of them have same editor config which is basically vim motions. My main vim config is aimed at C, Objc or C++ coding.

| Vim | Editor for any specific case. Coding, regular editing, markdown editing, any work. |
